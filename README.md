## Project Overview
This repository contains an ensemble-based short-term load forecasting (STLF) model for predicting hourly power consumption of Shepard Hall, a university building. The system combines Random Forest regression and LSTM networks with innovative ensemble strategies to achieve superior forecasting accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines white-box domain knowledge with data-driven ML
- **Ensemble Strategies**:
  - MSE-weighted average of predictions
  - Stacking-based meta-model (linear regression combiner)
- **Temporal Analysis**: Handles hourly consumption patterns and seasonal variations
- **Evaluation**: Real-world data from Feb 2020-Jan 2025 with Feb 2025 test set

## Abstract
> "Electricity load forecasting is critical for efficient power system operation, enabling optimal energy dispatch, cost reduction, and grid stability. [...] This work highlights the potential of hybrid machine learning approaches in building energy management systems."
